# Kaggle Competition IronHack
For this competitition I used two notebooks. One where I run all the EDA and cleaning, and another one where the machine learning was done. I used the RandomForestRegressor function to predict the value of those diamonds. Before doing so, I cleared the dataset from some outliers, turned cut, color and clarity columns to dummies and added a depth/table ratio column.
